Eden's [mission](/docs/overview/mission) is to make expressive generative AI tools which are accessible to creators, and to foster a fun, social, and collaborative ecosystem around AI art.

Our flagship product is a social network that enables creators to generate, share, and remix art, train custom models, and deploy interactive agents and chatbots. We also provide a [convenient SDK](/docs/sdk/quickstart) that allows developers to build their own apps on top of Eden.

Eden was founded by a team of artists, creative technologists, and longtime machine learners. We are [committed to open source](https://github.com/abraham-ai), and a highly community-driven project, with numerous ways for creators and developers to plug in and contribute.

# Overview

These docs are divided into two sections. 

The first section provides a set of guides for working with Eden as a creator, including:

- [How to use the creation tool](/docs/guides/creation) to make creations in the form of images, videos, and text.
- [How to train custom models or "concepts"](/docs/guides/concepts) in order to tailor the generators towards a specific domain, style, genre, or character.
- [How to deploy your own characters](/docs/guides/characters), autonomous creative agents with whom you can chat with, assign artistic tasks to, or challenge other characters to debates or games.

The second section is a technical reference containing:

- [An introduction to the Eden API and SDK](/docs/sdk/quickstart), a JavaScript library that allows you to interact with Eden programatically and build custom applications with it.
- [A guide for how to host custom models or code](/docs/sdk/generators) on Eden.
