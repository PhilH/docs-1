Eden aims to solve the problem of coordination in generative AI.

With the rise of generative models that produce realistic text, images, video, and sound, a new artform and industry has formed atop a relatively small cache of open-source models, datasets, code, and compute resources. Many tools, services, and APIs have emerged to support users of these resources and meet the needs of this ecosystem.

Despite the prevalence of open-source models and tooling, much effort is duplicated reinventing solutions to common problems such as data acquisition, training, customizing, deployment, and serving models in a reliable and efficient way. Most of these services are proprietary, creating platform risk for users and application developers.

Eden improves this by fostering a commons for the generative AI space. This is primarily accomplished by:

* an open-source full-stack platform for deploying your own custom model servers and embedding them in websites and applications. [Read more about our architecture](/docs/overview/architecture).
* a decentralized, web3-based user account model. [Read more about the user model](/docs/overview/users).
* an open, public, and decentralized provenance layer. [Read more about our provenance proposal](/docs/overview/provenance).

The goal of the Eden project is to bootstrap a new generation of sovereign applications that are mutually composable and interoperable.
