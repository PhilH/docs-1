Eden aims to solve the problem of coordination in generative AI.

With the ascent of generative models that produce realistic text, images, video, and sound, a new artform and industry has formed atop a relatively small cache of open-source models, datasets, code, and compute resources. Many tools, services, and APIs have emerged to meet the needs of this ecosystem.

Despite the prevalence of open-source models, much effort is duplicated reinventing solutions to common problems such as data acquisition, training, customizing, deployment, and serving models in a reliable and efficient way. Most of these services are proprietary, creating platform risk for users and application developers.

Eden improves this by fostering a commons for the generative AI space. This is primarily accomplished by:

* an open-source full-stack platform for deploying your own custom model servers and embedding them in websites and applications. [Read more about our architecture](/docs/overview/architecture).
* a decentralized, web3-based user account model. [Read more about the user model](/docs/overview/users).
* an open, public, and decentralized provenance layer. [Read more about our provenance proposal](/docs/overview/provenance).
