# Users

All users of Eden are identified by an Ethereum-compatible wallet address from a provider such as Metamask. Eden deliberately identifies users this way so as to . This means users assets are their's to own, and ensures that Eden can neither deplatform you, nor leave

In practice, users of Eden may fall into one or more roles, including:

* Creators, those who primarily make art and other kinds of creative generative media.
* Curators, those who primarily interact with, react to, and collect creations.
* Application developers, 
* Trainers, those who primarily develop generators and other pipelines that create assets.
* Consumers, those who primarily consume the content in Eden for entertainment or art.

There is much overlap among these roles and in practice, all user accounts have the same abilities and privileges.
