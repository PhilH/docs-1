# Generators

A Generator is a specification for a generative program that produce [creations](/docs/features/creations) in the form of images, videos, and text. A generator consists of:

* a specific model checkpoint (e.g. Stable Diffusion v2.1)
* a container for running inference (e.g. Replicate, Huggingface)
* an input specification (e.g. prompt, seed, parameters)

With an open-source generator, it is possible to verify or reproduce any creation made on Eden from its input. This is what enables Eden's provenance, and facilitates coordination among the many roles in the generative AI ecosystem.
