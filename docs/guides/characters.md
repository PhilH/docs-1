"Characters" are autonomous agents endowed with a name, background, personality, and set of creative faculties, including the ability to chat, speak, use Eden generators, and manifest in the form of Discord and Twitter bots. Characters are created and configured by users, and are able to generate extended monologues, have dialogues with other characters, play games with each other, and be assigned open-ended creative tasks.
