# Creations

Creations are the primary unit of content on Eden. They are generative multimedia assets produced by generators.

* **/create** is our basic text-to-image pipeline, powered by [Stable Diffusion XL](https://stability.ai/stablediffusion), allowing you to create images from text prompts and optional input images.
* **/remix** generates variations of input images without any prompts needed.
* **/interpolate** is an extension of /create in which you enter multiple prompts and get an interpolation video that morphs through those prompts.
* **/real2real** is similar to /interpolate, but instead of prompts, you upload a sequence of images and get a back a video which generates a smooth video morph through them.
* **/interrogate** letâ€™s you upload an image and get back a text prompt that describes that image, powered by [clip-interrogator](https://github.com/pharmapsychotic/clip-interrogator).
