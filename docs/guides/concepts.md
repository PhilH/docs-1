# Concepts

In Eden, "Concepts" are custom objects, styles, genres, and characters which you can compose with directly in prompts. Concepts are learned using the popular LoRA technique, and are trained by users by uploading several example images of the target concept. Once trained, concepts can be used in prompts to generate creations which feature that concept.
